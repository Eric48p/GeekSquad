I am currently employed as an Advanded Repair Agent at GeekSquad. One of the issues that my team is facing is note creation when checking in a device. Everyone has their own style of notes which makes it hard for the reapair agents to find information about a device quickly. I am making a simple form that allows the Consultation Agents to generate notes for device checkin in a specified format. This will train the agents using the form to write notes in a specifed way that the Repair Agents prefer.
